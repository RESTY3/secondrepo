        <p style="color:blueviolet" >Tourism in Uganda is focused on Uganda's landscape and 
            wildlife. It is a major driver of employment, investment and foreign exchange, 
            contributing 4.9 trillion Ugandan shillings (US$1.88 billion or €1.4 billion as 
            of August 2013) to Uganda's GDP in the financial year 2012–2013.[1]

            Tourism can be used to fight poverty in Uganda. There are the tourism companies 
            which employ people directly as drivers, guides, secretaries, accountants etc. 
            These companies sell products to tourists, for example art and crafts, traditional 
            attire. Tourism can also be operated online by the online based companies. Tourist 
            attractions in Uganda include national game parks, game reserves, traditional sites,
             and natural tropical forests. Traditional occasions like Mbalu in eastern Uganda,
              boat riding, waterfalls etc.
